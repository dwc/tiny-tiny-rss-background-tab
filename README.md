Tiny Tiny RSS Background Tab
===

When Google Reader announced it was shutting down, I moved to [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org/). In Tiny Tiny RSS, the standard action for opening links in a new tab also focuses the tab. This Chrome extension lets you configure a shortcut key to open items in a background tab.

In conjunction with the [googlereaderkeys plugin](https://github.com/markwaters/ttrss-plugin-googlereaderkeys) you can have a pretty efficient process for reading feeds.

This extension is based off of a similar one for Feedly:
